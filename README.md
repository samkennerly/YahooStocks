# YahooStocks [Python 3]

[yahoo_stocks.py](https://github.com/samkennerly/YahooStocks/blob/master/yahoo_stocks.py) is a simple Python module for importing Yahoo! Finance chart data.

It includes two different adjusted closing prices which account for splits and dividends. 'Adj Close' is Yahoo's adjusted price. For back-testing strategies, 'TotalValue' may be more useful.
