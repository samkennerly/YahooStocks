# YahooStocks

YahooStocks is a short, simple Python module for importing Yahoo! Finance historical data into pandas.

It includes two different adjusted closing prices which account for splits and dividends. 'Adj Close' is Yahoo's adjusted price. For back-testing strategies, 'TotalValue' may be more useful.

For examples, see the YahooStocks.ipynb IPython Notebook.
